# Pokeom: Evolved

## Introduction
Pok√©mon: Evolved is a hack of Leaf Green where all of the original Gen I pokemon now evolve at least two more times expanding the Pokedex from the original 151 to 354. All new evolutions have custom front and back sprites, pokedex entries, and shiny variants. 

Stats, movesets, and even evo levels have been completely reworked to make for a fun challenging experience! Modified route encounters make it so that every single pokemon from Gen I is findable and catchable in a single solo playthrough. 


+ Infinite Rare Candies are in the PC (if you exit PC, rare candies replenish)
+ EXP all is on by default
+ Physical/special split with moves implemented 
+ A select few post gen3 moves/abilities were added into the game
+ All mons either evolve through lvls or with stones (no new evos require stones)
+ All trade evos are now lvl ups
+ All friendship evos are also lvl ups
+ Stone evos remain intact
+ Stone seller in Celadon has all stones you may ever need available for purchase!
+ Need to teach HMs/have an HM intern
+ The game is balanced to obtain badges in gym order
+ Dont go to the sevii islands (they are boring lmao)
+ Do not go back to the SS Anne after leaving (plz)
